--------------


## Overview

Baka MPlayer is a free and open source, cross-platform, **libmpv** based multimedia player.
Its simple design reflects the idea for an uncluttered, simple, and enjoyable environment for watching tv shows.


## Requirements

* gcc
* pkg-config
* libmpv-dev
* qtbase5-dev (>= 5.2.0)
  * qt5-qmake
  * qttools5-dev-tools
  * qtdeclarative5-dev
  * libqt5svg5-dev
  * libqt5x11extras5-dev
  * libqt5network5
* youtube-dl (optional, for streaming youtube videos)

Note: Packages may be named slightly different for each distro

### Get the font

Baka MPlayer was designed around the font called Noto Sans. Noto Sans was used because of its open source nature and its broad support for Unicode characters. Having the correct font installed insures that what you see is what was intended.

## Compilation

### Windows

These instructions are for cross-compiling for Windows on a Linux system (Note: the architecture can be either `x86_64` or `i686` depending on which platform you're compiling for).
```
git clone -b release https://github.com/u8sand/Baka-MPlayer.git
cd "Baka-MPlayer"
mkdir build
cp -r windows/cross-compilation/* build/
cd build
arch=x86_64
./baka-build.sh $arch
```
This is a very long process because you'll need to build the mingw32 toolchain `mxe` and all dependent libraries, `libmpv.a`, and finally `baka-mplayer.exe`. If everything succeeded without error, you'll get `Baka-MPlayer.$arch.zip` which should contain everything you need.

To rebuild simply delete the directory (in build) or the .zip file of what you need to rebuild and re-run `./baka-build.sh $arch`.

To add custom patches, put them in `src/patches/` prefixed with the name of what you're patching.

### Linux

If your distribution does not provide a package, you can compile it from source.
However we've made scripts for some distributions. See `etc/sbin/linux/`.
```
git clone -b release https://github.com/u8sand/Baka-MPlayer.git
cd "Baka-MPlayer"
mkdir build
cp -r linux/* build/
cd build
distro=debian_based
./$distro.sh
```
If this doesn't work or the distro you use is not listed here, you'll need to build mpv and then Baka MPlayer (the dependencies above are for Baka MPlayer). For help building mpv see `https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv-build`. Compiling Baka MPlayer from source can be done like so:
```
git clone -b release https://github.com/u8sand/Baka-MPlayer.git
cd "Baka-MPlayer"
./configure
make -j `grep -c ^processor /proc/cpuinfo`
sudo make install
```
The configuration file will be created on first run and will be written to `~/.config/bakamplayer.ini`.

### macOS

As of right now you have to compile from source.
You require some more dependencies which you can get from homebrew:
```
brew install youtube-dl
brew install mpv --with-libmpv
git clone -b release https://github.com/u8sand/Baka-MPlayer.git
cd Baka-MPlayer
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
brew install qt5
export QMAKE=/usr/local/Cellar/qt5/5*/bin/qmake
./configure CONFIG+=install_translations
make
open build
```
Then drag the app to your Applications folder.
In the future there will be a brew formula to simplify this.

Similarly to Linux, the configuration file will be created on first run and will be written to `~/.config/bakamplayer.ini`.

### Other languages

By default, Baka MPlayer will compile in English if no language is specified during compilation. To compile a multi-lingual version of baka-mplayer, configure it like so:

    ./configure CONFIG+=install_translations

For more configuration options see the `configure` source file or read the manual.

You can check out which languages we currently support by checking out `Baka-MPlayer/src/translations/`.
