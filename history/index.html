<h2>History of Baka MPlayer</h2>

<p>Baka MPlayer had different names before, but it's fundamental goals were the same. An easy to use multimedia player that could play anything and was not in your way.</p>

<h3>AniPlayer (early High School years)</h3>

<p>Before it was called Baka MPlayer, it was called AniPlayer (then AniPlayer X). This was written in VB.NET. Design wise, it wasn't beautiful. It used Vista-era graphics and default .NET controls.</p>

<h3>Niko Neko Pureya (late High School years)</h3>

<p>Technology change! I gained experience and it was now coded in C#. The name was also changed to Niko Neko Puryea. It still wasn't beautiful but it no longer used stock controls.</p>

<h3>Baka MPlayer (early College years)</h3>

<p>A new name! The word "baka" is a non offending way of saying stupid in Japanese. The engine was based off of MPlayer. Therefore it was a media player that anyone could use. This was also coded in C#. It's design started to settle down. It also had simple voice command ability.</p>

<h3>Baka MPlayer (later College years till now)</h3>

<p>My friend u8sand showed interest in helping out with the project. He was a Linux user so we agreed to make it cross platform. We decided to utilize the open source, cross-platform Qt framework. Qt had a different way of styling its UI from .NET. It allows the usage of CSS to customize it's look and feel. I took advantage of that.</p>

<p>And presently it looks like this:</p>

<p>For those of you joined us, we thank you very much. And those who've yet to try out Baka MPlayer, I urge you to try it out. It changed the way I watched video's and hope it does for you too.</p>
